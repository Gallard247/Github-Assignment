# Github-Assignment
College assignment for learning Github. Please ignore, as it has to be public

I have no idea how the hell this works but in the main folder is 3 of my lab assignments, from the past 3 labs ecept 10 because I have procrastination issues


_But anyway,_

* Assignment 7 was a disappearing shape that followed the mouse cursor, but only the shape is original. Most of the code came from the assignment example, but it came with the added benefit of giving me an example of how that code works.
* Assignment 8 was an image test, where I had one static image as the background and another image which I moved around with code. PErsonally, I think the end result is really funny
  * Requires server usage
* Assignment 9 was a really hard one to wrap my head around, because it has 4 requirements and one of them didn't seem to appear on any of the examples. It took a while, but it uses microphone input, camera input, and can play a sound.
  * Also requires server usage
